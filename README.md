EABC Global, a leading supplier of high-quality hair care raw materials, has established itself as a trusted partner for businesses seeking the finest ingredients to formulate shampoos, conditioners, scalp treatments, and other hair care solutions. With a comprehensive portfolio that includes cutting-edge ingredients such as Zinc Pyrithione (ZPTO), Ketoconazole, Betaine, and Coco amido propyl Betaine, EABC Global delivers innovative raw materials that drive success in the hair care industry.
 Zinc Pyrithione (ZPTO): The Ultimate Scalp Soothing Ingredient
Zinc Pyrithione (ZPTO) is a well-known active ingredient in hair care products, particularly in treatments for dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. EABC Global sources premium-quality ZPTO, known for its potent antifungal and antimicrobial properties. This powerful ingredient is effective in treating scalp conditions, reducing flakiness, and soothing irritation, making it a staple in anti-dandruff shampoos, conditioners, and scalp treatments.
ZPTO works by inhibiting the growth of Malassezia, a yeast-like fungus commonly associated with dandruff, thereby improving the overall health of the scalp. Its gentle yet effective formula makes it suitable for both therapeutic and everyday use, making it a popular choice for consumers looking for relief from scalp issues.
 Ketoconazole: A Highly Effective Antifungal Solution
Ketoconazole is another vital ingredient for hair care formulations, particularly in treatments targeting dandruff and fungal-related scalp conditions. EABC Global’s Ketoconazole is sourced with the highest quality standards in mind to ensure its efficacy and safety in topical applications. This powerful antifungal agent works by eliminating the fungi responsible for scalp conditions, such as dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, while also promoting healthier, cleaner hair.
Ketoconazole is commonly used in medicated shampoos and scalp treatments, where it provides long-lasting relief from symptoms like itching, flaking, and redness. It is often recommended for individuals with persistent scalp issues, ensuring they can maintain a healthy scalp microbiome and enjoy beautiful, clear hair.
 Betaine: A Gentle Moisturizer with Multiple Benefits
Betaine is a naturally derived ingredient known for its ability to hydrate, soften, and protect hair without weighing it down. EABC Global’s Betaine is sourced from sustainable sources, ensuring that it meets the highest standards for purity and performance. Betaine is an excellent humectant, attracting moisture to the hair and scalp, and improving the hair’s overall texture, making it more manageable and shiny.
In addition to its moisturizing properties, Betaine also acts as a mild surfactant and foaming agent, helping to create rich lather in shampoos and body washes while being gentle on the skin. It enhances the performance of formulations, offering a natural and sustainable alternative to harsher chemicals. As a result, Betaine is a go-to ingredient for products aimed at nourishing and revitalizing dry or damaged hair.
 Coco amido propyl Betaine: The Versatile Surfactant
Coco amido propyl Betaine is a mild surfactant derived from coconut oil that is commonly used in hair care products for its excellent foaming, cleansing, and conditioning properties. EABC Global’s Coco amido propyl Betaine is a versatile and eco-friendly ingredient that helps to create luxurious, soft textures in shampoos, conditioners, and cleansers. It is known for its ability to create rich, creamy lather without stripping hair of its natural oils, making it perfect for sensitive scalps or products formulated for children and individuals with skin sensitivities.
Additionally, Coco amido propyl Betaine offers excellent conditioning benefits, leaving the hair feeling soft, smooth, and easy to detangle. It’s an important component in many sulfate-free and "gentle care" formulations, offering a safe and effective way to clean the hair while maintaining hydration and balance.
